# Project â€“ Python - Seat distribution by political parties

## Overview
In Portugal, electoral laws for the Parliament, regional assemblies, local authorities, and the European Parliament adopt a proportional representation system. This method involves dividing each party's vote total by integers starting from 1, with seats allocated based on the highest quotients.

## Example
An electoral district with 10 seats showcases this method's application:
- **Party A**: 5 seats (2460, 1230, 820, 615, 492)
- **Party B**: 3 seats (1830, 915, 610)
- **Party C**: 1 seat (940)
- **Party D**: 1 seat (800)

The seats correspond to the ten highest quotients achieved.

## Objective
The goal is to develop a Python program that, given the number of parties, their vote totals, and the available seats in an electoral district, distributes these seats among the parties accordingly.

> **Note**: Ireland uses a different electoral system known as the Single Transferable Vote (STV).
