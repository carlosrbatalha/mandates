In Portugal, electoral laws for various bodies use a proportional representation system, dividing party votes by integers from 1 for seat allocation. For example, Party A gets 5 seats, B 3, C and D 1 each, based on the highest quotients. A program is needed to distribute seats based on vote totals and available seats.
